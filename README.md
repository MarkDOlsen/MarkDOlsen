# Mark D. Olsen
### Hobbyist, TTRPG-enthusiast, and data-lover

- I’m interested in Table-top Roleplaying Games, Digital Art (Blender and Photoshop), and Data Science.
- I’ve been coding as a hobby since my dad signed me up for my first coding class way back in 1978 where I learned BASIC on a TRS-80.
- I studied computer science in college but switched to a business major and now work in finance, far from my early coding days.
- Over the years I've used various versions of BASIC, C++, COBOL, Fortran, Pascal, and VBA but am super rusty in most of those. These days I mostly work in Python and SQL and dabble in R.
